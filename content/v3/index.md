Spin is a framework for building and running event-driven microservice applications with WebAssembly (Wasm) components.

Spin uses Wasm because it is **sandboxed, portable, and fast**.  Millisecond cold start times mean no need to keep applications "warm".

Many languages have Wasm implementations, so **developers don't have to learn new languages or libraries**.

Spin is **open source** and **built on standards**, meaning you can take your Spin applications anywhere.  There are Spin implementations for local development, for self-hosted servers, for Kubernetes, and for cloud-hosted services.

**Want to see the kinds of things people are building with Spin?**  Check out what's [Built With Spin](./see-what-people-have-built-with-spin)!
