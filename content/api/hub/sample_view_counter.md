This example shows a simple page view counter using TypeScript and Key Value Store.

It illustrates usage of four KV functions:

* `openDefault()`
* `exists()`
* `getJson()`
* `setJson()`

There is a [complete tutorial on Dev.to](https://dev.to/technosophos/storing-state-between-serverless-requests-with-typescript-and-spin-3p3i) describing this code.
