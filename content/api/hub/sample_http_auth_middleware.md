This sample shows how to compose a middleware component with a business logic component using [Spin 2.0](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-spin-v2) and the Component Model. 

## Instructions

### Install Prerequisites

* Install [`cargo component`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component cargo-component
```

* Install a fork of [wasm-tools](https://github.com/dicej/wasm-tools/tree/wasm-compose-resource-imports):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/dicej/wasm-tools --branch wasm-compose-resource-imports wasm-tools --locked
```

* Install latest [Spin](../../spin/v2/install)
* Create an OAuth App in your [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers). 
  * Set the callback URL to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/login/callback`. 
  * Accept defaults and input dummy values for the rest of the fields.
  * Save the Client ID
  * Generate a new Client Secret and save that as well

### Build And Run The Spin App

```bash
# Build the middleware
cargo component build --manifest-path github-oauth/Cargo.toml --release

# Build and run the example
spin up --build -f example -e CLIENT_ID=<YOUR_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID> -e CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET>

# Open http://127.0.0.1:3000/login in a browser

# Deploy to Fermyon Cloud
spin cloud deploy
```
