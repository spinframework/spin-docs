This project showcases how to do internal HTTP routing in a Spin Python application. It is similar to [the Spin JS router](../../spin/v2/javascript-components#routing-in-a-component) as well as the Django router.

If you are interested in external routing (where the routing table is declared in the spin.toml), the [Application Structure guide](../../spin/v2/spin-application-structure) covers this.

This uses the absolutely fantastic [http_router](https://pypi.org/project/http-router/) project. You will likely want to reference the API docs:
* https://github.com/klen/http-router. 

Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/spinframework/spin-python-sdk/tree/main/examples/external-lib-example) for instructions on how to get started
